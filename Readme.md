# CodingBat Exercises

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to complete all the CodingBat problems, but I did my best.

I completed the full **String 1**, **Warmup 1**, and **Warmup 2** sections as instructed, creating separate branches for each category.  
For the remaining categories I was able to work on, I completed about half or more. For each of those categories, I used **one branch and one Java file per category** to save time while solving the problems.

The only exception is **Logic 2**, which I fully completed because it was a small category.

Thank you for understanding.
